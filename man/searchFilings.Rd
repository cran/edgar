\description{
\code{searchFilings} Search EDGAR filings for specific keywords
}
\details{
searchFilings function takes search keyword vector, CIK(s), form type(s), and 
year(s) as input parameters. The function first imports available 
downloaded filings in the local woking directory 
'edgar_Filings' created by \link[edgar]{getFilings} function; 
otherwise, it automatically downloads the filings which are not already been 
downloaded. It then reads the filings and searches for the input keywords. 
The function returns a dataframe with filing information and the number of 
keyword hits. Additionally, it saves the search information with surrounding 
content of search keywords in HTML format in the new directory 
"edgar_searchFilings". These HTML view of search results would help the user 
to analyze the search strategy and identify false positive hits. 
User must follow the US SEC's fair access policy, i.e. download only what you 
need and limit your request rates, see \url{https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data}.
