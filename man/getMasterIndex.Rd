\code{getMasterIndex} retrieves the quarterly master indexes from the U.S. SEC EDGAR server.
}
\details{
getMasterIndex function takes filing year as an input parameter from a user,  
downloads quarterly master indexes from the US SEC server.
www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/full-index/. It then strips headers from the 
master index files, converts them into dataframe, and 
merges such quarterly dataframes into yearly dataframe, and stores them 
in Rda format. It has ability to download master indexes for multiple years 
based on the user input. This function creates a new directory 'edgar_MasterIndex' 
into current working directory to save these Rda Master Index. Please note, for 
all other functions in this package need to locate the same working 
directory to access these Rda master index files. 
User must follow the US SEC's fair access policy, i.e. download only what you 
need and limit your request rates, see www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data.
