\description{
\code{getBusinessDescr} retrieves business description section from annual statements 
based on CIK number(s) and filing year(s).
}
\details{
getBusinDescr function takes firm CIK(s) and filing year(s) as input parameters from 
a user and provides "Item 1" section extracted from annual statements along with 
filing information. The function imports annual filings (10-K statements) downloaded 
via \link[edgar]{getFilings} function; otherwise, it automates the downloading process 
if not already been downloaded. It then reads the downloaded statements, cleans HTML tags, 
and parse the contents. This function automatically creates a new directory with 
the name "edgar_BusinDescr" in the current working directory and 
saves scrapped business description sections in this directory. It considers "10-K", 
"10-K405", "10KSB", and "10KSB40" form types as annual statements. 
User must follow the US SEC's fair access policy, i.e. download only what you 
need and limit your request rates, see www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data.
